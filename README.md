# WEBAPPS-11

Pitch: Our team is building a web-based volunteer management system to help nonprofits/volunteering organizations monitor, orchestrate their volunteering events, and allow members to volunteer with a single unified platform for creating volunteer opportunities, signing up for those opportunities, verifying attendance, and tracking volunteer hours. This free web-based application improves over manual spreadsheets and hour sheets, and is also better than existing platforms that require expensive subscriptions.
